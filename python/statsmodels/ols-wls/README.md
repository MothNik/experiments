Some examples of using [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
to perform ordinary and weighted least squares regression.

* `ols_linear.py`: Ordinary least squares, linear regression.
* `ols_quadratic.py`: Ordinary least squares, quadratic regression.
* `wls.py`: Weighted least squares.  This example is from Section 9.4
   of *Applied Regression Analysis* (3rd ed.) by Draper and Smith.
   The code is heavily commented to explain how I reproduced the
   results given in the text.
