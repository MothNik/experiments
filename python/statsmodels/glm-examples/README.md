Some examples of using the generalized linear models (GLM)
from [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html).

* `statsmodels_glm_example.py`: Minimalist GLM example.
* `draper_smith_18_4.py`: Compute the results shown in section 18.4 of
  *Applied Regression Analysis* (third edition, 1998) by Draper and Smith.
  It is an application of the generalized linear model, using the Poisson
  family and the natural (i.e. log) link.
* `glm_poisson_example.py`: Reproduces the Poisson regression example at
  [The Analysis Factor](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/generalized-linear-models-in-r-part-6-poisson-regression-count-variables/).
