# dry-wet-i-e-include-partial-raw-signal-parameter-on-iir-notch-filter-before-c

"""
First, a couple observations:

* To incorporate the "wet" factor, we can use a little algrebra.
  An IIR filter can be represented as the rational function

              P_B(z)
      H(z) =  ------
              P_A(z)

  where P_A(z) and P_B(z) the polynomials in z^-1.  A notch filter
  will have a gain of 0 at the center frequency, but you want to
  mix the "wet" and "dry" (i.e. filtered and unfiltered) signals.
  Let w be the "wet" fraction, 0 <= w <= 1, so w = 0 implies no
  filtering, w=0.25 implies the gain is 0.75 at the notch frequency,
  etc.  Such a filter can be expressed as

                              P_B(z)   (1 - w)*P_A(z) + w*P_B(z)
      H(z) =  (1 - w) + (w) * ------ = -------------------------
                              P_A(z)            P_A(z)


  In terms of the arrays of coefficients returned in a call such
  as `b, a = iirnotch(w0, Q, fs)`, the coefficients of the modified
  filter are `b_mod = (1-w)*a + w*b` and `a_mod = a`.

* `iirnotch(w0, Q, fs)` returns two 1-d array of length 3.  These
  are the coefficients of the "biquad" notch filter.  To create
  a new filter that is a cascade of several notch filters, you
  can simply stack the arrays returned by `iirnotch` into an
  array with shape (n, 6); this is the *SOS* (second order sections)
  format for a filter.  This format is actually the recommended
  format for filters beyond a few orders, because it is numerically
  more robust than the (b, a) format (which requires high order
  polynomials).
