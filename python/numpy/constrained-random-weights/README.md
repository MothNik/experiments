The file ``random_weights_with_ineq_constraints.py`` contains a function
the generates random sets of weights in which the weights sum to 1
and satisfy given inequality constraints.

This plot shows an example.  The light gray triangle is the surface defined
by w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 1.  The light blue box indicates the region in [w₁, w₂, w₃]-space
where the inequalities 0.05 <= w₁ <= 0.2, 0.25 <= w₂ <= 0.65 and 0.4 <= w₃ <= 0.6
are satsfied.  The intersection of the triangle and the box is the set from which
we want to draw random samples.  The dots within that region are samples that
were generated by the function ``random_weights()``.
